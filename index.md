# Code / Move / Listen
My name's Chris.

I build software, move a lot, and collect, write & record music.

By day that means shaping and leading complex systems as a principal engineer; outside of that it’s running, cycling, CrossFit, and generally seeing how far I can go. Music sits alongside it all — things I make, things I’m listening to, and a growing vinyl collection. I also have a footwear addiction. 

This site is a simple place for [Code →](/code.html) / [Move →](/move.html) / [Listen →](/listen.html).
